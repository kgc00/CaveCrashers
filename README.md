# CaveCrashers

# Overview
WIP - a multiplayer, turn based game where players explore a procedurally generated grid to find treasure. 

## Notes
Written using a DLL centric flow: all possible code is pure c#, imported to unity through DLL's. This adds a bunch of complexity in exchange for access to constructors, lightning quick tests and iteration.
